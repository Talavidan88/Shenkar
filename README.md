### Notes
 - This project is the final assignment at Shenkar's Methods In Software Engineering. We created a simple API for creating  console based forms using win32 API.

 - API is identical to published skeleton.

 - We decided not to implement inheritance for compound controls, as NumberBox **is-not a** panel. therefore we decided to use composition.
 
 - Previous versions are available, For current version please go to **Final Project**.
 
 - Final Project has a main file using Michael's main exemple.
 
 - Running this project is only possible on windows machines. (duh!)
 
### Usage:
